# Algorithm Patterns — Cheatsheet

Common patterns:
- Two-pointers: O(n) window or opposing pointers
- Sliding window: variable-size window, sum/unique tracking
- Fast/slow pointers: cycle detection, middle element
- Divide and conquer: recursion, merge-sort style
- Dynamic programming: memoization, tabulation
- Graphs: BFS/DFS, shortest path, union-find
